% There are several possible answers to this so the check
% is based on the stacked wheel equations.

% Wheel 1, the far right wheel
alpha1 = 0;
beta1 = 0;
ell1 = 0.5;


% Wheel 2, the top left wheel
alpha2 = 2*pi/3;
beta2 = 0;
ell2 = 0.5;
      

% Wheel 3, the bottom left wheel
alpha3 = 4*pi / 3;
beta3 = 0;
ell3 = 0.5;
